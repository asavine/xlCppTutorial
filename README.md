Exporting C++ code to Excel : a quick and painless tutorial by Antoine Savine

To export calculation C++ code to Excel is extremely practical. Excel, with all its flexibility and convenience, basically
becomes the front end of your C++ application for free. 
Unfortunately, this is not a particularly intuitive and painless process. 
Books have been written on the topic, including Dalton’s excellent 600 pager:
Financial Applications using Excel Development

For the benefit of my students and colleagues, I wrote a quick and painless tutorial. The tutorial is in the pdf file,
and the rest are the necessary files to make it work. 

I have had excellent feedback from people who found the tutorial particularly helpful, and decided to publish it for everybody’s benefit.
Comments and suggestions are most welcome.
